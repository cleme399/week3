# Comparing web mapping libraries - 9/22/2015

This week we're going to look at the most commonly used web mapping libraries that are out there.

We're going to split up into teams. Each team will be assigned a web mapping library. There are a few questions I want each group to answer. What I'm hoping to create at the end of class is a matrix describing the best features of each library, the relative ease of getting started, and a general sense of when each may be the best choice for a given project.

## The contenders

1. [ArcGIS JavaScript API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)
2. [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/)
3. [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
4. [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
  - Since we've already used Leaflet a bit, I want this group to also look at [**mapbox.js**](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.2.2/), which is built on top of Leaflet.

## The questions
1. How much work does it take to create a very basic map? (i.e. setting a center lat/long and zoom on a basemap)
  - Things to consider
    + Do you need to register?
    + How many lines of code do you need?
2. What options are there for choosing a basemap?
  - Can you use your own?
  - What premade options are there?
3. Roughly how many samples or tutorials are available?
  - How helpful do they seem to be?
4. Is the documentation easy to find? Is it well organized? Does it make sense?
5. Is it possible to include the following data sources as layers? (also, how easy is it to include them?)
  - ArcGIS Server/ArcGIS Online services
  - WMS/WFS services
  - GeoJSON
  - Shapefiles
  - CSV
  - Any others?
6. Is it capable of the following (if so, rate trickiness).
  - Projection related stuff (using a custom one, performing transformations,...)
  - Rotating map (make north point down, etc)
  - Legend
  - Editing
  - Driving directions
  - Geocoding
  - Any others?
6. Is the library **extensible**?
  - That means, if it lacks a feature you need, is it possible to add your own to it? (plugins)
  - If so, how easy/difficult does it seem to be?

## Overall impressions from each group
- What do you think?
- When does it seem like this library would be a good choice?
